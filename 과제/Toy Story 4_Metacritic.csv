                                This franchise has demonstrated an impressive ability to beat the odds and reinvent itself, over a span of time long enough for two generations to grow up in. It's a toy store of ideas, with new wonders in every aisle.

                                A diverting, visually dazzling concoction of wily schemes and daring adventures, Toy Story 4 achieves that something that eludes most sequels, especially this far into a series: a near-perfect balance between familiarity and novelty, action and emotion, and joyful hellos and more bittersweet goodbyes.

                                What is the meaning of life? When that question is posited in a deeply moving post-credits scene, the answer is like the film you just watched: incredibly funny and devastatingly true.

                                Toy Story 4 delivers a cinematic grand slam, a nine-years-later sequel that's wholly equal to the high expectations raised by the terrific trio that it follows. Touching, raucously funny, adventurous and yes, even profound, Pixar's signature property once again touches them all.

                                Cooley bursts out of the gate in his directorial debut with high energy, tight storytelling, a rousing adventure, laugh out loud comedy, charming new characters, and most importantly, a tender, and dare I say personal, core.

                                The fourth entry is a worthy addition to the Toy Story library, bringing back some of the most beloved characters in the history of animated film and introducing us to a fantastically entertaining new bunch of toys <U+2014> some of them adorable and huggable, some of them more reminiscent of a certain type of creepy, old-school doll usually seen in R-rated horror films.

                                Pixar could easily retire this series with a clean sweep of films that have been lovely to look at and moving and funny to watch. But if they can maintain this level of wonderful, keep ¡®em coming.

                                The first thing to note about Toy Story 4 is that it is extremely funny: I¡¯d argue it¡¯s the most consistently comedic of the entire series

"13","Peter Rainer","91","
                                It doesn¡¯t put you through the emotional wringer the way its predecessor did, but it¡¯s consistently inventive, funny, witty, and heartfelt. In other words, it¡¯s a lot better than it has any right to be. It¡¯s more than good enough to justify its existence.

"14","Karen Gordon","91","
                                The focus on Woody means that Toy Story 4 is less of a metaphor about the things we leave behind as we leave childhood, which means emotionally it's the lightest of the series.  That may mean fewer hankies for those of us sitting together in the dark falling in love all over again with a box of animated toys.  But the sweetness persists.

"15","Vince Mancini","91","
                                Toy Story 4 works overtime to find the humanity in all its characters, even the scary ones, despite the fact that it exists in a world of sentient toys and anthropomorphic garbage. That is not only endearingly sweet, but kind of wild.

                                As Cooley¡¯s film quickens and deepens, we get a fabulous running joke about the ¡°inner voice,¡± a staple of American self-will since the days of Emerson.

                                For a series that began nearly 25 years ago, this classic in the making couldn¡¯t go out on a more fitting note of tender, tear-drenched resolution.

                                It bounces along at such an antic pace that its 100 minutes feel like far fewer. But there¡¯s a quiet contemplativeness at the movie¡¯s heart, exemplified by a long scene in which Woody and Forky make their way along the shoulder of a highway, plastic hand in pipe-cleaner hand, discussing the meaning of life as a plaything.

"20","Bilge Ebiri","90","
                                The film never quite lets us know what to feel. It¡¯s an unnerving little movie, one that at any given moment might deliver a burst of feeling, or a big laugh, or a jump scare. It whipsaws you this way and that, and this sense of disorientation is new for a company whose work usually feels so carefully calibrated, so perfectly put-together.

"23","Kenneth Turan","90","
                                The film surprises with the amount of genuine emotion it generates with its focus on love, loyalty and what matters most in life, to humans as well as toys.

"24","Todd McCarthy","90","
                                Ultimately, what gives Toy Story 4 genuine heft is that it's a tale of second chances and characters who take advantage of them. Like its predecessors, the film is rambunctious, noisy, genial, unpretentious, action-packed and old-fashioned in a very good way.

                                Toy Story 4 not only delivers plenty of gonzo-funny moments and genuine thrills, but also interrogates and complicates the series¡¯s core themes.

In a current market crowded with franchises and pricey theatrics, Toy Story 4 feels like a warm and welcome aside, spinning an epic yarn from an intimate vantage with all the amenities of Pixar¡¯s supremely talented creators and animators.

                                To talk about Toy Story 4 is to talk about Forky. This is a movie that doesn¡¯t initially appear to have any compelling reason to exist <U+2014> the forced but satisfying third installment of Pixar¡¯s signature franchise seemed to wrap things up when it came out almost a full decade ago <U+2014> and yet Forky alone is enough to elevate this potential cash-grab into the beautiful and hilarious coda that its long-running series needed to be truly complete. Forky is the hero we need in 2019.

                                Woody and Buzz et al are still wonderful creations, and time spent in their company is rarely wasted. But riffs about new owner Bonnie starting kindergarten and once-favoured toys getting left in the cupboard smack of old ground being retrodden.

                                Occasionally too busy and loose with its logical rigor, Toy Story 4 doesn¡¯t quite connect all the dots.

                                The basic pleasures of this fourth installment may be at once more hectic and more shopworn, but the film preserves, at least, the pathology of its series: that anxiety about finding meaning and your own place on the shelf.
